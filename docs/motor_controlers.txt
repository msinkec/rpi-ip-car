Forwards/backwards motor controler description(ebay):
    It is 2.5A power-enhanced motor drive module with silicone line, pin, terminal, 
    whose power supply voltage can be 2V ~ 10V, and it can drive two DC motors or 
    a 4-wire 2-phase stepper motor, also can achieve positive and negative Turn and 
    speed function with thermal protection and can automatically restore.
    Specifications:
    1. module supply voltage: 2V-10V.
    2. Signal input voltage: 1.8-7V.
    3. Single Operating current: 2.5A;
    4. Standby current: less than 0.1uA.
    5. The mounting hole diameter: 2mm.
    6. Product Size:3.3 * 3.1 * 0.5cm/1.3*1.22*1.97inch
    7. Built-in common conduction circuit, when the input pin is left floating, the motor does not malfunction.
    8. Built-in thermal protection circuit with hysteresis effects (TSD), without worrying about motor stall.


    Precautions:
    1. Power positive and negative reversed will certainly cause damage to the circuit.
    2. Output is shorted to ground or output short circuit, and the motor stall, the chip will heat protection, but in the near or exceeding 10V voltage and peak current is greater than 2.5A situation can also cause chip burned.
