# IP based RC-car
The goal of this project is to controll a RC-car via IP.
The cars motors themselves are controlled with a Raspberry PI, which is connected to a network.
The application running on the Raspberry PI (rc-car) is listening for controlls, which are sent by the controller application (rc-controller) running on another computer.
There also is a camera feed being sent from the Raspberry PI and displayed by the controller.
